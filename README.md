# Developer Notes

1. To be frank with you, I have no idea what is project is anymore.
2. I have a vague idea of what the project looks like, and I hate it, please don't look at it.
3. Don't even read the code, it's horrendous. I promise I'm better by at least one *HelloWorld.html* now.

# Project Information

This project was supported by Overflow SIG at Ngee Ann Polytechnic. The project was used for three separate events:
1. National Robotics Competition 2018 (Singapore), 1st place
2. World Robot Olympiad 2018 (Chiang Mai, Thailand), 26th place
3. Ngee Ann Polytechnic Open House 2019

The project team consists of myself, two other members, and a supervisor.

This web applcation is one of many components of the project. The project has something to do with growing crops vertically on a platform floating on the ocean. This web application is used to monitor the conditions (humidity, temperature, and air pressure) inside the farm. This is achieved by pulling data from Firebase's Realtime Database, which was uploaded by a Sense HAT module on a Raspberry Pi.

Probably has other features but I forgot and am too lazy to check.
